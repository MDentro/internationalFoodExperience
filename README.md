## Introduction
Many people will ask themselves what they should eat today. This is why this application is useful.
After registration people can log in and start searching for a nice recipe. If the user needs some inspiration
they can choose for a rondom recipe. If the user doesn't like the random recipe they can press the button and get another.

There is also a search option for people that are looking for something more specific. Choose for category or origin and browse
through the possibilities. When the choice is made it is time to start cooking or go shopping. 

The application is mobile friendly, so it is also possible to search for a recipe in the supermarket.
